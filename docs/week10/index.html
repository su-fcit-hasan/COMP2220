                Client-side scripting is a type of computer programming that is executed by the user's web browser. It is a type of code that is executed by the web browser and the user will see the results. An example of client-side scripting is JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                Server-side scripting is a type of computer programming that is executed on the server. It is a type of code that is executed by the server and the user will not see the results. An example of server-side scripting is PHP.
            </li>

        <h2>Excercise 2 - week10</h2>
        What are the main limitations of the JavaScript as compared to server side scripting languages like PHP?
        <ul>
            <li>
                JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it is executed on the user's web browser. This means that the user can see the code and manipulate it. This can be a security risk, as the user can see the code and potentially exploit it. Server-side scripting languages like PHP are executed on the server, which means that the user cannot see the code and cannot manipulate it. This makes server-side scripting languages more secure than JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript is limited to the capabilities of the user's web browser. This means that JavaScript can only do what the web browser allows it to do. Server-side scripting languages like PHP are not limited by the capabilities of the user's web browser, which means that they can do more than JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript is not as fast as server-side scripting languages like PHP. This is because JavaScript is executed on the user's web browser, which means that it is limited by the speed of the user's web browser. Server-side scripting languages like PHP are executed on the server, which means that they are not limited by the speed of the user's web browser.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Excercise 3 - week10</h2>
        Describe the main responsibilities of a Web Server. 
        <p>         
            A web server is a computer program that is responsible for accepting HTTP requests from clients, such as web browsers, and serving them with HTTP responses, usually with HTML pages. The main responsibilities of a web server are to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A web server is responsible for storing web pages and other web content, such as images, videos, and other files. This content is stored on the web server's hard drive or other storage devices. 
            </li>
            <li>
                A web server is responsible for processing web pages and other web content. This means that the web server is responsible for executing server-side scripts, such as PHP, and generating dynamic web pages. 
            </li>
            <li>
                A web server is responsible for delivering web pages and other web content to clients. This means that the web server is responsible for sending web pages and other web content to clients when they request it. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Excercise 4 - week10</h2>
        Describe the structure of a PHP file? How PHP code will execute on your computer? 
        <p>
            A PHP file is a text file that contains PHP code. The structure of a PHP file is similar to the structure of an HTML file, but it contains PHP code instead of HTML code. A PHP file can contain HTML code, PHP code, and other types of code, such as JavaScript and CSS. The structure of a PHP file is as follows:
        </p>
        <div style="overflow:auto;position:relative;margin-bottom: 1em;background:#f8f8f8;color:#212529;font-family:Monaco,Consolas,monospace;font-size:1.0em;line-height:1.8;border-radius:4px;"><pre style="background:#f8f8f8;border:none;"><span style="color:#999999;font-weight:bold">&lt;?php</span>
            <span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold">echo</span> <span style="color:#d14">"Hello World"</span><span style="background-color:#f8f8f8">;</span>
            <span style="color:#999999;font-weight:bold">?&gt;</span></pre></div>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    &lt;?php
                    echo "Hello World";
                    ?&gt;
                </pre>
            </code>

            -----
            <code>
                <pre>
                    <?php
                    echo "Hello World";
                    ?>
                </pre>
            </code>
