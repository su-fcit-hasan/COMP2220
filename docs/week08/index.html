        <h1>1- What is JavaScript, and why is it important in web development?</h1>
        <p>Javascript provides interactivity webpages and compatibility with all browsers.</p>
        <h1>2 - How does JavaScript differ from HTML and CSS?</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is primarily responsible for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to a webpage on the 
            client side. HTML provides the structure and semantics of the content, while CSS handles the 
            presentation and layout, ensuring a visually cohesive and appealing design. Together, these three 
            technologies form the core building blocks of modern web development, allowing developers to create 
            rich and interactive user experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>3 - Explain the difference between var, let, and const</h1>
        <p> - var: Function-scoped, hoisted, and can be redeclared and reassigned.<br>
            - let: Block-scoped, hoisted, and can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.<br>
            - const: Block-scoped, hoisted, must be initialized during declaration, and cannot be reassigned <br>
            after initialization.
